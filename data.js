<p><strong>Dissidents and Radicals:</strong> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the siege drags on, and the War Council solidifies its role, its relatively meritocratic nature inspires radical thoughts among certain dissidents.

<p><strong>Debt Collectors:</strong> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">My lord, an Emissary appeared in front of our Gates this morning asking for an audience.

<p><strong>Council Reform</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Regency Council has done well enough under the circumstances in safeguarding the realm for the King&rsquo;s return, but if we wish to survive the dangers before us, we must see to an end of this politicking and chaos that rules the Central Keep. We can ill afford to waffle as we have much longer. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Council Vote:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We must Ensure Equality among the Council&rdquo; Whenever the &ldquo;Elect a New Regent&rdquo; Action is taken, rather than taking a skill test, all characters not in the Dungeon get a single vote for or against the targeted character becoming Regent, majority winning and ties failing. When a Regent Choice is made, if all other Defenders agree, then the Council may change the decision to a different outcome than the Regent picked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We must Centralize Power further!&rdquo; Whenever a Council Vote is decided, the Regent may discard one Royal Decree to veto the Vote, resolving the second highest outcome instead.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Smugglers: </strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard-eyed, cunning men and women snuck through a sewer grate last night.

<p><strong>Patriotism: </strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patriotism is a fickle thing to manage.

<p><strong>Army Reform: </strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of veterans-professionals from the start of the war-came before the Council today with a list of requests they claimed represented the will of the Army. They raised concerns such as being conscripted with deferred payments, many of which would never be paid out to their families if they died in battle, while being kept in line by corporal punishment. Obviously we can&rsquo;t give into their demands, but perhaps we could offer some token reforms? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Council Vote:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see about Widow Benefits&rdquo; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">These soldiers fight not just for their King and his Council, but for their families most of all.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Harvest Festival: </strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual harvest festival has been an unbroken tradition for a century since its formal adoption by the crown. We are stretched thin, but we must find some goods squirreled away we can afford to sacrifice, or else the peasantry will say the land is cursed and reject us for failing to make the proper offerings. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewardship 5 Test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pass: -1 Supplies +1 Loyalists.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ritual of Fertility:</strong> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ritual of Fertility is largely held to be a symbolic affair, true, but the rote motions actually involve invocation of local nature spirits, begging them for good harvest and weather for the following year. Surely you understand we cannot postpone this most sacred event, Regent? </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regent Choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Offer a Great Sacrifice&rdquo; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good things come to those who wait. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">-2 Mana -2 Supplies. Shuffle the card &ldquo;Bountiful Blessings&rdquo; into the deck.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Black Market:</strong> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course a Black Market is an issue! Even ignoring how they sidestep market fees, reduce the taxable wealth in circulation, and undermine Council Authority, these underground markets don&rsquo;t just make goods appear out of thin air-by some means they&rsquo;re stealing from our stores for private gain. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stewardship + Intrigue 8 Test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pass: -1 Loyalists.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Give into their Demands&rdquo; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have no choice. We cannot risk a mass insurrection in the ranks in the middle of battle. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">-1 Treasury for every Army sallied forth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Oaths and Threats&rdquo; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether with inspirational speeches or deadly punishments, measures must be taken to keep the men in line.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Leadership + Military 13 Test.</span></p>

<p><strong>Supply Lines</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent attacks on our baggage trains have resulted in our soldiers in the field running dangerously low on essentials such as food and arrows. We&rsquo;ll need to send out special resupply shipments, or else risk neutering our forces.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Council Vote.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Prepare the Wagons&rdquo; </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping our Armies in peak condition must be our highest priority.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -1 Supplies for every Army sallied forth.</span></p>
